// Support for Skyhawk Science System.
//
// Embedded computing cores are introduced slowly over tiers 2 through 5,
// upgraded through tiers 6 to 9, and finally upgraded to unlimited computing
// resources at tier 11.
//
// Upgrades are tied to the "Probe Cores" (probes#) branch of the tree for uncrewed
// probe cores, and to the "Comand Modules" (capsules#) branch for the crewed modules
// (up to tier 9). The final upgrade to unlimited computing is tied
// to the "AI" node (probes11) for everything.
//
// The dedicated parts from kOS itself are used as specialized, dedicated
// options for computing needs just a bit ahead of the current level for
// the embedded cores. To make up for that advantage, they are typically
// heavier, and of course they are extra parts. In detail:
// - CX-4181 stays at tier 3, but is nerfed from its original stats to
//   the "early_advanced" stats from Embedded kOS Kirkuits. It will get
//   an upgrade at tier 5 which restores the original stats.
// - KR-2042 b is moved to tier 5
//   as an early option for the "default" computing needs
// - the "CompoMax Radial Tubeless" stays at tier 7
// - the KAL-9000 stays at tier 9
// - All dedicated parts are upgraded to "unlimited" at tier 11, along with
//   everything else
